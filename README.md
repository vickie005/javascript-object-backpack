# 🎒 My JavaScript Backpack #

Welcome! This is a fun little JavaScript practice file where I created a backpack as an object with different properties and methods.

## 📄 What’s Inside ##

The backpack has several features built into it, including:

## ✨ Properties ##

name: The name of the backpack (e.g. "Everyday Backpack")

volume: How much it can carry

color: The backpack’s color

pocketNum: Number of pockets

strapLength: An object that tracks the length of the left and right straps

lidOpen: A boolean that tells us if the lid is open or closed

## 🔁 Methods ##

toggleLid(lidStatus): Changes the lid to open or closed

newStrapLength(left, right): Updates the strap lengths on both sides

## 🔍 What You Can Do ##

This script logs out info like:

The full backpack object

Strap length values

Pocket count (accessed two different ways)

You’ll also see how functions can update parts of the object.

## 🚀 Running the Code ##

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then open a terminal and run:

* node script.js *

This will show outputs in the console based on the object and its methods.

## 🎯 Why I Made This ##

This project is all about learning the basics of JavaScript objects — how to create them, add properties and functions, and access or update values dynamically.
